#### 1. Module to Install

To run this code, you need to install the following module:

- TextBlob: This module provides tools for processing textual data, including spell checking and correction. You can install it using a package manager like pip.

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code reads a text file, checks it for spelling errors, corrects those errors, and then saves the corrected text to a new file. It also provides a report on the corrections made.

#### 3. How Does the Code Work?

1. Reading the File:
   - The code starts by opening and reading the content of a text file specified by the user. This file is expected to contain the text that needs spell checking.

2. Spell Checking and Correction:
   - The content of the file is then processed using the TextBlob library. TextBlob analyzes the text and identifies any spelling mistakes.
   - It attempts to correct these spelling mistakes and generates a corrected version of the text.

3. Displaying Corrections:
   - The code compares the original text with the corrected text to identify and count the corrections made.
   - It displays each word that was corrected, showing the original word and the corrected version.

4. Saving the Corrected Text:
   - If any corrections were made, the code saves the corrected text to a new file. The new file is named by appending `_corrected` to the original fileâ€™s name, ensuring that the corrected text does not overwrite the original.
   - If no corrections were necessary, it simply informs the user that no changes were needed.

5. User Interaction:
   - The main function prompts the user to enter the path of the text file they want to check.
   - It then calls the function to perform the spelling check and correction based on the provided file path.

This code allows users to perform spelling correction on a text file using the TextBlob library. It reads the text from the file, uses TextBlob to identify and correct spelling errors, and then saves the corrected text to a new file. The code also provides feedback on the corrections made, helping users see which words were changed.
