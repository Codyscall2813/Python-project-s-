### Modules to Install
1. requests: This module is used to make HTTP requests to APIs. You can install it using: pip install requests

2. Pillow: A library for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It is used to handle image processing in Python. Install it using: pip install pillow

3. ttkbootstrap: A library for styling tkinter applications, making them look more modern and user-friendly. Install it using: pip install ttkbootstrap

### Purpose of the Code
This code creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that fetches and displays a random cat fact and a picture of a cat. The application uses APIs to get the cat facts and images, and displays them in the window.

### How the Code Works

1. API Endpoints:
   — The code uses two APIs:
     — CAT_IMAGE_API: Provides a random image of a cat.
     — CAT_FACT_API: Provides a random fact about cats.

2. Fetching Data:
   — `fetch_cat_fact()`: This function sends a request to the cat fact API and retrieves a random fact. If there's an error during the request (like no internet connection), it handles the exception and returns a failure message.
   — `fetch_cat_image()`: This function retrieves a random cat image. It processes the image to fit within a specified size using the Pillow library and prepares it for display in the GUI.

3. Updating the GUI:
   — `generate_cat()`: This function is triggered when the user clicks the "Generate" button. It calls the above functions to fetch a new cat fact and image, and updates the GUI elements (labels) with the new data.

4. Creating the GUI:
   — The GUI is created using the `tkinter` library with additional styling from `ttkbootstrap`.
   — The main window (`root`) is set with a title and size.
   — A `frame` is used to organize the layout.
   — `fact_label` displays the cat fact text, and `pic_label` displays the cat image.
   — A `generate_button` triggers the `generate_cat()` function to fetch new data.

5. Running the Application:
   — The `root.mainloop()` starts the Tkinter event loop, which waits for user interactions and updates the GUI accordingly.

### How to Use the Application
1. Starting the Application: Run the script. Ensure you have an internet connection, as the app fetches data from online APIs.
2. Generating Cat Facts and Images: Click the "Generate" button to fetch a new random cat fact and image. The fact will be displayed as text, and the image will appear below it.
3. Error Handling: If there is an issue fetching data (like a network error), appropriate error messages will be displayed instead of the cat fact or image.
