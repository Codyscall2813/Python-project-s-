### What You Need

— Module Installation: You will need to install the `tkinter` and `math` modules. `tkinter` is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the calculator, and `math` is used for mathematical operations like calculating square roots. `tkinter` is included with Python, so you don't need to install it separately.

### What the Code Does

This code creates a simple calculator application with a graphical user interface. Here’s how it works:

1. Setup:
   — The code starts by importing the necessary modules: `tkinter` for the GUI, `math` for mathematical functions, and `PhotoImage` for displaying an icon.
   — It initializes the main window for the calculator, setting its title, size, and icon.

2. Display:
   — The calculator has a display area (an entry box) at the top where the user can see the current input and results.

3. Button Functions:
   — The calculator has various buttons for numbers, arithmetic operations, and special functions. Each button triggers a specific function when clicked:
     — Clear (C): Clears the entire display.
     — Backspace (⌫): Deletes the last character entered.
     — Clear Entry (CE): Clears the display.
     — Equal (=): Evaluates the expression shown on the display and shows the result.
     — Square Root (√x): Calculates the square root of the number entered.
     — Square (x^2): Squares the number entered.
     — Reciprocal (1/x): Calculates the reciprocal (1 divided by the number).
     — Percentage (%): Converts the number to a percentage.
     — Toggle Sign (+/-): Changes the sign of the number (positive to negative or vice versa).

4. Button Creation:
   — Buttons are created and arranged in a grid layout. Each button is linked to a function that defines what happens when the button is clicked. This includes updating the display or performing calculations.

5. Main Program Loop:
   — The program runs a loop that keeps the calculator window open and responsive to user actions. This loop waits for user input (like button clicks) and updates the display accordingly.

### How It Works

1. Button Functions:
   — Each button performs a specific action. For instance, if the user clicks the button for addition, the calculator prepares to add numbers.

2. Display Updates:
   — When buttons are clicked, they either update the display with numbers and operators or perform a calculation based on the current input.

3. Error Handling:
   — If there’s an error during a calculation (like dividing by zero), the calculator shows an "Error" message.

4. Visual and Functional Layout:
   — The buttons and display are organized in a grid, and the calculator’s appearance and functionality are managed through the `tkinter` library.

This code creates a functional calculator with a GUI that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and some additional mathematical functions. The calculator’s design and behavior are managed using the `tkinter` module for the interface and the `math` module for calculations.
