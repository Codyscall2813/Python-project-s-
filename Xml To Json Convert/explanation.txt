#### 1. Modules to Install

You need to install the `xmltodict` module if it's not already available in your Python environment. You can install it using: `pip install xmltodict`


The `json` and `os` modules are part of Python's standard library and do not require separate installation.

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This script is designed to convert XML data from a file into JSON format and save it to another file. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. Read XML Data:
   - Check File Existence: It first checks if the specified XML file exists in the file system. If the file does not exist, it prints an error message and stops further processing.
   - Open and Read File: If the file exists, it reads the entire content of the XML file.

2. Parse XML Data:
   - Parse XML: The XML content is then parsed into a Python dictionary using the `xmltodict` library. This library converts XML data into a structured dictionary format, making it easier to work with in Python.

3. Convert to JSON:
   - Convert Dictionary to JSON: The parsed dictionary is then converted into JSON format using Python’s `json` library. JSON is a popular data format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines alike.

4. Write JSON Data to File:
   - Save JSON: The resulting JSON data is written to a new file specified by the user. This involves opening the output file in write mode and saving the JSON data into it.

5. Error Handling:
   - Handle Exceptions: If any error occurs during the reading, parsing, or writing processes, it catches the exception and prints an error message describing what went wrong.

#### Detailed Breakdown

1. File Handling:
   - Checking Existence: Ensures the input file exists before attempting to read it.
   - Reading and Writing: Handles file operations for reading XML data and writing JSON data.

2. Data Conversion:
   - XML to Dictionary: Uses `xmltodict` to transform XML into a dictionary.
   - Dictionary to JSON: Uses `json.dumps` to convert the dictionary into a JSON-formatted string.

3. User Interaction:
   - File Paths: The script uses hard-coded file paths for the XML input and JSON output files. These paths are where the XML data is read from and where the converted JSON data is saved.

4. Execution Flow:
   - Main Function: When the script is run, it triggers the `xml_to_json` function with specified file paths, performing the conversion and saving the results.
