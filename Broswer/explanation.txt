### Modules to Install

— PyQt5: This library is used to create graphical user interfaces in Python. It includes tools for making windows, buttons, and other widgets. To install it, run `pip install PyQt5` in your terminal or command prompt.

### What the Code Does

This code creates a simple web browser application using PyQt5. Here's how it works:

1. Setup PyQt5 Application:
   — The code begins by setting up a PyQt5 application. This is the framework that allows you to create graphical user interfaces in Python.

2. Create the Main Window:
   — The main window of the application is created. This is the primary window where all the components of the browser will be displayed.

3. Add a Web Browser:
   — A web browser component is added to the main window. This component is responsible for displaying web pages. It is initialized to open the DuckDuckGo search engine by default.

4. Configure the Navigation Toolbar:
   — A toolbar is added to the main window. This toolbar contains several buttons to help with navigation:
     — Back Button: Allows the user to go back to the previous web page.
     — Forward Button: Allows the user to go forward to the next web page.
     — Reload Button: Refreshes the current web page.
   — Each button is connected to a specific action that interacts with the web browser.

5. Add a URL Bar:
   — A text input field (URL bar) is added to the toolbar. This allows the user to type in a web address.
   — When the user presses the "Enter" key after typing a URL, the browser navigates to the entered address.

6. Update the URL Bar:
   — The URL bar is automatically updated to show the current web address of the page being displayed. This is useful for keeping track of which page is currently being viewed.

7. Run the Application:
   — The application is started, and the main window is displayed. The application will keep running, waiting for user interactions like button clicks or typing in the URL bar.

### How It Works

1. Initialize:
   — The application and main window are set up.

2. Display the Browser:
   — The browser component is embedded in the main window and set to show a default web page.

3. Add Navigation Controls:
   — Buttons and a URL bar are added to the toolbar to allow navigation and interaction with the web browser.

4. Handle User Input:
   — User actions like clicking buttons or typing a URL are handled to navigate web pages or update the URL bar.

5. Update and Refresh:
   — The URL bar reflects the current page, and the browser responds to user commands.

This code sets up a basic web browser application with navigation buttons and a URL bar, allowing users to browse the web and interact with web pages using a simple graphical interface.
