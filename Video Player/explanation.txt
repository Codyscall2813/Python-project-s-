#### 1. Modules to Install

To run this code, you need to install the following Python libraries:
- `cv2`: This module is part of OpenCV, a library for computer vision tasks. You can install it with `pip`: `pip install opencv-python`
- `ffpyplayer`: This library is used for playing video and audio files. Install it with: ` pip install ffpyplayer`
 

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code is a simple command-line video player that allows you to:
1. List Video Files: Find all video files in a specified directory.
2. Select a Video: Choose which video to play from the list.
3. Play the Video: Display the video on the screen and play its audio.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation:

1. List Video Files:
   - The code looks for files in a given directory that have video file extensions such as `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, etc.
   - It gathers all these video files and provides a list to the user.

2. Select a Video:
   - The user is prompted to choose a video from the list by entering a number.
   - The code ensures the selected number is valid and corresponds to an actual video file.

3. Play the Video:
   - Once a valid video file is selected, the code uses OpenCV (`cv2`) to read and display the video frames.
   - It uses the `ffpyplayer` library to handle the audio part of the video.
   - The video is displayed in a window, and the user can press the 'q' key to stop playback.

4. Error Handling:
   - The code checks if the provided directory exists and if it contains any video files.
   - It also handles cases where the selected video file cannot be found or played.
