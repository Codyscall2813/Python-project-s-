#### 1. Modules to Install

This code uses standard Python modules, so you do not need to install any additional packages.

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This script reads the contents of a text file and counts both the number of words and the number of characters in that file. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. Define Functions:
   - `count_words_and_characters` Function: 
     - Purpose: Takes a block of text as input.
     - Process: It splits the text into words and counts how many words there are. It also counts the total number of characters in the text.
     - Returns: The function returns two numbers: the word count and the character count.

2. Main Function:
   - Filename Input: 
     - User Prompt: Asks the user to enter the name of the text file they want to analyze.
   - File Handling:
     - Open File: Attempts to open the specified file in read mode.
     - Read Content: If successful, it reads the entire content of the file into a variable.
   - Counting:
     - Call Function: Uses the previously defined function to count words and characters in the text read from the file.
     - Display Results: Prints out the number of words and characters.
   - Error Handling:
     - File Not Found: If the file does not exist, it shows an error message.
     - Other Errors: Catches and displays any other errors that might occur during file handling.

3. Program Execution:
   - Entry Point: When the script is run, it starts by calling the `main` function to perform the file operations and counting tasks.

#### Detailed Breakdown

1. Counting Words and Characters:
   - Words: The text is split into individual words using spaces as separators, and the total number of these words is counted.
   - Characters: The total number of characters in the entire text, including spaces and punctuation, is counted.

2. File Operations:
   - Opening and Reading: The script opens a text file specified by the user, reads its content, and processes it.
   - Error Handling: If the file does not exist or another issue occurs while handling the file, appropriate error messages are shown.

3. User Interaction:
   - Input and Output: The script interacts with the user through input prompts and prints results, making it a simple yet practical tool for text analysis.
