#### 1. Modules to Install

To run this code, you'll need to install the following libraries:

- `tkinter`: This is included with Python and doesn't require separate installation. It's used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- `PIL` (Pillow): This library is used for image processing. Install it with: `pip install Pillow`
- `ttkbootstrap`: A library that provides a modern look for Tkinter widgets. Install it with: `pip install ttkbootstrap`
- `requests`: This library is used to make HTTP requests. Install it with: `pip install requests`

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code creates a simple GUI application to get and display weather information for a city using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Here's how it works:

1. Setup and Imports:
   - The code starts by importing the necessary libraries. `tkinter` is used for creating the GUI, `PIL` for handling images, and `requests` for making HTTP requests to the weather API. `ttkbootstrap` is used to enhance the look of the Tkinter widgets.

2. Fetch Weather Information:
   - The `get_weather` function is responsible for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It builds a request URL with the city name and API key, sends a request, and processes the response to extract weather details like temperature, description, and an icon.

3. Search Function:
   - The `search` function is triggered when the user clicks the search button. It reads the city name entered by the user, calls `get_weather` to get the weather details, and updates the GUI with this information. It also handles errors if the city is not found or if there are issues fetching the data.

4. GUI Components:
   - Main Window: The application window is created using `ttk.Window` with a specified theme and size.
   - City Entry: A text entry field where the user types the city name.
   - Search Button: When clicked, it triggers the `search` function to fetch and display the weather information.
   - Labels: Several labels are used to display the city name, weather icon, temperature, and description.

5. Image Handling:
   - The weather icon is downloaded from the web and displayed in the GUI. If there is an issue with loading the image, an error message is shown.

6. Event Loop:
   - The `root.mainloop()` function starts the Tkinter event loop, which keeps the application running and responsive to user actions.
