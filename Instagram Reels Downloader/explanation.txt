#### 1. Modules to Install

To run this code, you'll need to install the following Python modules:

— requests: For making HTTP requests to interact with web services.
— beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML content from web responses.

Install them using:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code creates a command-line application that downloads videos from Instagram posts using their URLs. It fetches video content from a specific API, processes it, and saves the video files to a local directory on your computer.

#### 3. How the Code Works

1. Setup and User Input:
   — Main Function: The `main` function starts the application, welcoming the user and prompting them to enter Instagram post URLs. It continues to run until the user types 'exit'.
   — Directory Creation: If the directory for saving videos doesn't already exist, the code creates it.

2. Fetching Video Data:
   — API Request: The application sends a POST request to an external API (a service that helps to download Instagram media) using the URL of the Instagram post provided by the user.
   — Headers and Data: The request includes necessary headers and data to specify the type of content (video) to be fetched.

3. Processing the Response:
   — HTML Parsing: Once the API responds, the code parses the response using BeautifulSoup, which is a library that helps in extracting data from HTML documents.
   — Finding Download Link: The code looks for the specific download link for the video within the HTML content.

4. Downloading the Video:
   — Video Download: The code sends another request to download the video file from the link found in the previous step.
   — Saving the File: The video file is then saved locally with a unique filename in the 'downloaded_reels' directory.

5. Error Handling:
   — Exceptions: The code handles errors that may occur during HTTP requests or file operations, printing appropriate error messages if something goes wrong.

This script provides a way to download videos from Instagram posts using URLs. It involves:

— Asking the user for Instagram post URLs.
— Fetching video data from an API.
— Parsing the response to find the download link.
— Downloading and saving the video to a specified directory on the local machine.
