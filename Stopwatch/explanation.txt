#### 1. Module to Install

To use this code, you need to install:

- Tkinter: This is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. It usually comes pre-installed with Python, so you might not need to install it separately.

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code creates a simple stopwatch application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows you to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch, and it displays the elapsed time in a formatted manner.

#### 3. How Does the Code Work?

1. Setting Up the GUI:
   - The application uses Tkinter to create a window with three buttons (Start, Stop, and Reset) and a label to display the elapsed time.
   - The window is configured with a specific size and background color, and a custom font is used for the time display.

2. Creating the Stopwatch:
   - The stopwatch displays elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
   - It updates the displayed time every 50 milliseconds to reflect the current elapsed time accurately.

3. Handling User Actions:
   - Start Button: When pressed, it starts or resumes the stopwatch. It calculates the start time by subtracting the elapsed time from the current time.
   - Stop Button: When pressed, it stops the stopwatch but keeps the current elapsed time.
   - Reset Button: When pressed, it stops the stopwatch and resets the elapsed time to zero, clearing the displayed time.

4. Time Calculation and Formatting:
   - The elapsed time is calculated as the difference between the current time and the start time.
   - The `format_time` function converts this elapsed time into a string formatted as hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

5. Updating the Display:
   - The `update_time` method updates the label with the formatted time.
   - It continuously calls itself every 50 milliseconds using the Tkinter `after` method to keep the display updated.

6. Running the Application:
   - The main part of the code initializes the Tkinter window and creates an instance of the `StopwatchApp` class.
   - The `mainloop` method of Tkinter is called to start the application and keep it running until the user closes the window.

This code sets up a simple stopwatch application using Tkinter. It provides a user interface with buttons to control the stopwatch and a label to display the time. The stopwatch functionality includes starting, stopping, and resetting the timer, with the elapsed time updated in real-time.
