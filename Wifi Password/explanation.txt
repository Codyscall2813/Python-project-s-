#### 1. Modules to Install

The code uses the `subprocess` module, which is part of Python's standard library. You do not need to install it separately.

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This script retrieves the name and password of the currently connected Wi-Fi network on a Windows machine. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of its functionality:

1. Retrieve Connected Wi-Fi Name:
   - Command Execution: The code uses the `subprocess` module to run a system command that fetches information about the Wi-Fi interfaces on the computer.
   - Data Parsing: It parses the output to find the name (SSID) of the currently connected Wi-Fi network.

2. Retrieve Wi-Fi Password:
   - Command Execution: It runs another system command to get details about the Wi-Fi profile of the connected network, including the password.
   - Data Parsing: It searches through the command output to find and extract the password.

3. Output the Results:
   - Display: The script prints the name of the connected Wi-Fi network and its password if available. If no password is found or if there’s an issue retrieving the data, it provides appropriate messages.

#### Detailed Breakdown

1. Function: `get_connected_wifi_name`:
   - Purpose: Retrieves the SSID (name) of the currently connected Wi-Fi network.
   - How: It executes the `netsh wlan show interfaces` command, which lists details about wireless interfaces. It then looks for the line containing "SSID" and extracts the name from it.

2. Function: `get_wifi_password`:
   - Purpose: Retrieves the password for a given Wi-Fi profile.
   - How: It executes the `netsh wlan show profile [profile_name] key=clear` command, where `[profile_name]` is the name of the Wi-Fi profile. It looks for the line containing "Key Content" and extracts the password from it.

3. Function: `main`:
   - Purpose: Orchestrates the process by first fetching the connected Wi-Fi name and then getting the password for that network.
   - How: It calls the `get_connected_wifi_name` function to get the current Wi-Fi network name and then uses `get_wifi_password` to retrieve and print the password.
