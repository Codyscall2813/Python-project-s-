#### 1. Modules to Install

For this code to run, you need to install the following Python module:
— `pygame`: This module is used for creating games and multimedia applications. It handles graphics, sound, and input.

You can install it using the following command: `pip install pygame`

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code creates a simple Ping Pong game using the Pygame library. The game features two paddles and a ball, and players control one of the paddles to hit the ball back and forth. The game keeps track of the score and displays instructions until the game starts.

#### 3. How Does the Code Work?

1. Initialize Pygame:
   — The Pygame library is initialized to set up the game environment.
   — The game window is created with a specific width and height, and its title is set to "Ping Pong Game".

2. Define Game Objects:
   — Ball: A circular object that moves around the screen and bounces off paddles and walls.
   — Paddles: Rectangular objects controlled by players. One paddle is for player 1, and the other is for player 2.

3. Set Up Game Variables:
   — Variables for the ball's speed and direction, paddle speeds, and scores are initialized.
   — A font is set up for displaying scores and instructions.

4. Define Game Functions:
   — `move_ball`: Updates the ball's position, handles bouncing off walls and paddles, and checks for scoring.
   — `move_player1`: Controls the movement of player 1's paddle based on user input.
   — `move_player2`: Automatically controls player 2's paddle to follow the ball.
   — `reset_ball`: Resets the ball's position and randomly adjusts its direction when a player scores.
   — `display_instructions`: Shows instructions on the screen if the game hasn't started.

5. Game Loop:
   — The game continuously processes user inputs, such as key presses and releases, to control the paddles and start the game.
   — If the game hasn't started, instructions are displayed.
   — Once the game starts, the ball and paddles are updated, and the screen is redrawn with the current game state, including scores.
   — The frame rate is controlled to ensure smooth gameplay.

6. Handling User Input:
   — Key presses and releases are detected to move player 1's paddle up and down.
   — Player 2's paddle moves automatically.

7. Updating the Display:
   — The game screen is updated regularly to reflect the current state of the ball, paddles, and scores.

This code sets up a basic Ping Pong game where one player controls a paddle with the up and down arrow keys, and the other paddle is controlled automatically. The game includes features like scoring, ball movement, and paddle control. Pygame is used to handle graphics and input, creating an interactive and enjoyable game experience.
