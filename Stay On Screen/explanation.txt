#### 1. Module to Install

To use this code, you need to install the following module:

- PyAutoGUI: This module allows you to programmatically control the mouse and keyboard. You can install it using a package manager like pip.

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code is designed to keep your computer from going into sleep mode or activating any screen saver by moving the mouse cursor periodically.

#### 3. How Does the Code Work?

1. Purpose:
   - The main goal of the code is to simulate mouse activity to prevent your computer from entering sleep mode or activating a screensaver. This can be useful if you want to keep applications active without manual intervention.

2. Movement of the Mouse:
   - The code continuously moves the mouse cursor back and forth every 10 seconds. It does this by moving the mouse a small distance to the right and then back to the left.
   - This movement is achieved using PyAutoGUI, which can move the mouse cursor to specified coordinates or relative to its current position.

3. Timing:
   - The code includes a delay of 10 seconds between each mouse movement to prevent continuous motion, which would be too disruptive.
   - This is controlled by a sleep function that pauses the execution of the code for 10 seconds between movements.

4. Stopping the Process:
   - The code runs in an infinite loop, continuously moving the mouse as long as the program is running.
   - If you want to stop the process, you can use a keyboard shortcut (CTRL-C). This will interrupt the loop and terminate the program.

5. User Interaction:
   - When you start the program, it will display a message informing you that you can stop it with CTRL-C.
   - Once started, it will keep running until you manually stop it.

This code keeps your computer active by periodically moving the mouse cursor back and forth. It uses PyAutoGUI to control the mouse and includes a sleep interval to regulate the frequency of movement. The process runs indefinitely until manually interrupted with CTRL-C. This can be useful for preventing your computer from entering sleep mode or triggering a screensaver during long periods of inactivity.
