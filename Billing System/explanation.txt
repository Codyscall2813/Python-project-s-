### Modules to Install

— Tkinter: This is a built-in library in Python for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). You don’t need to install it separately if you are using the standard Python distribution.
— Random: This is another built-in module used for generating random numbers.
— OS: This is a built-in module used for interacting with the operating system, like creating directories.

### What the Code Does

This code creates a simple billing software application with a graphical interface using Tkinter. The application allows users to manage a basic store’s billing process. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Creating the Application Window:
   — The application opens a window with a title "Billing Software" and sets up its layout.

2. Setting Up Customer Details:
   — It has a section where you can enter customer information like name, phone number, and a unique bill number.

3. Product Categories:
   — There are three categories of products: Medical, Grocery, and Cold Drinks.
   — For each category, you can input quantities for various products.

4. Bill Area:
   — There's a section to display the bill. This area will show the items purchased, their quantities, prices, taxes, and the total amount.

5. Button Controls:
   — Total: Calculates the total price and tax for the items in each category.
   — Generate Bill: Creates a bill with all the details and displays it in the bill area.
   — Clear: Resets the input fields and the bill area.
   — Exit: Closes the application.

6. Generating and Saving the Bill:
   — When you generate a bill, the software creates a formatted bill with all details and saves it as a text file in a directory called "bills".
   — You can search for and view previously generated bills by their bill number.

7. Handling Errors and User Interaction:
   — The software provides error messages if required fields are missing or if an invalid bill number is entered.
   — It uses message boxes to inform users about errors or successful actions.

### How It Works

1. Initialization:
   — When the application starts, it sets up the window, defines the product categories and their prices, and initializes various user input fields.

2. User Interaction:
   — Users input their details and select quantities for the products.
   — When they click the "Generate Bill" button, the software calculates the total price and tax, displays it, and saves it.

3. Data Management:
   — It saves bills as text files in a directory and can retrieve and display these files if requested.

This code provides a user-friendly way to manage store transactions by allowing users to enter details, select products, generate bills, and save or retrieve those bills as needed.
