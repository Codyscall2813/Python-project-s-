### Modules to Install

— Pygame: This is a popular library used to create video games and graphical applications. You can install it using pip (Python's package installer). Run `pip install pygame` in your terminal or command prompt.

### What the Code Does

This code creates a simple graphical simulation where multiple balls bounce around the screen. Here’s how it works:

1. Initialize Pygame:
   — The code starts by initializing the Pygame library. This prepares Pygame to manage the graphical window and handle user input.

2. Set Up the Display:
   — The program creates a window for the simulation with dimensions 800 by 600 pixels.
   — It sets a background image and a window icon to enhance the visual appeal.

3. Define the Ball Class:
   — Ball Images: Each ball has an image that is loaded from a file.
   — Gravity: A constant is used to simulate gravity, which makes the ball fall over time.
   — Initialization: Each ball starts with an initial speed and position, which is randomly set within certain bounds.
   — Rendering: The ball's image is drawn on the screen at its current position.
   — Movement: The ball's position is updated based on its speed. It also reacts to collisions with the edges of the screen by bouncing off them.

4. Create Multiple Balls:
   — A list of five balls is created, each with its own initial position and speed.

5. Main Program Loop:
   — This loop keeps the program running and updates the display continuously.
   — It checks for user actions (like closing the window). If the user closes the window, the loop stops, and the program ends.
   — The background image is redrawn to ensure the balls move smoothly.
   — Each ball is rendered (drawn) on the screen, and its position is updated based on its speed and gravity.

6. Update the Display:
   — After drawing everything, the display is updated to show the latest frame of the simulation.

7. Quit Pygame:
   — When the user closes the window, the program exits, and Pygame shuts down cleanly.

### How It Works

1. Setup:
   — The window and images are prepared.

2. Create Balls:
   — Multiple balls are initialized with their own properties.

3. Simulate Movement:
   — In the main loop, the balls are continuously moved and bounced based on their interactions with the window edges.

4. Render and Update:
   — The display is updated in real-time to show the balls bouncing around.

This code sets up a graphical window where balls bounce around, demonstrating basic principles of motion and collision detection in a fun and visual way.
