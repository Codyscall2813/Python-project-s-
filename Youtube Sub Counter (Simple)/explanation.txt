#### 1. Modules to Install

You need to install the `requests` module if it's not already installed. You can do this using: `pip install requests`

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This script monitors the subscriber count of a specific YouTube channel in real-time. It fetches data from a public API and displays updates on the subscriber count when it changes.

#### 3. Detailed Breakdown

1. API Setup:
   - URL: The script uses a specific URL to fetch subscriber count data for a YouTube channel.
   - Headers: Custom headers are included in the request to mimic a real browser request and potentially bypass some web security checks.

2. Fetching Subscriber Count:
   - Send Request: A GET request is sent to the API endpoint with the specified headers.
   - Parse Response: The response is parsed as JSON to extract the subscriber count.
   - Error Handling: If thereâ€™s an issue with the request (e.g., network problems or invalid response), an error message is printed.

3. Monitoring:
   - Initial Fetch: The script fetches the subscriber count once at the start to get the initial value.
   - Continuous Monitoring: It enters a loop where it continuously fetches the current subscriber count every 2 seconds.
   - Update Display: If the subscriber count changes from the last fetched value, it updates the display in the terminal. It uses a carriage return to overwrite the previous output, so the display is updated on the same line.

4. Exit Handling:
   - Keyboard Interrupt: The script can be stopped by the user pressing `Ctrl+C`, which triggers a graceful exit with a termination message.
