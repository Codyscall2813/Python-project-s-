#### 1. Modules to Install

To run this code, you need to install the following Python libraries:
— requests: This library is used to make HTTP requests to fetch data from the web.
— Pillow: This library is used for image processing tasks.
— tkinter: This is a standard library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. Note that it comes pre—installed with Python, so you don't need to install it separately.
— ttkbootstrap: This library enhances the appearance of Tkinter widgets by applying modern themes. You can install it using pip with the following command: `pip install ttkbootstrap`
  
#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code creates a simple GUI application that allows users to fetch and display random images based on selected categories from an online image API.

#### 3. How the Code Works

1. Setting Up the GUI:
   — Main Window: The code sets up a window with a specific size, title, and background color using the Tkinter library.
   — Theme: It applies a modern theme to the interface using the `ttkbootstrap` library.
   — GUI Elements: It includes a dropdown menu for selecting image categories, a button to generate images, and a label to display the fetched image or an error message.

2. Fetching and Displaying Images:
   — Category Selection: Users can choose an image category from a dropdown menu. Categories include "Food," "Animals," "People," and others.
   — Generate Button: Once a category is selected, the "Generate Image" button becomes enabled. Clicking this button triggers a function that fetches a random image from an API related to the selected category.
   — API Request: The code makes an HTTP request to the Unsplash API to get a random image URL based on the selected category.
   — Image Processing: The image data is processed using the Pillow library to resize it and convert it into a format suitable for display in the Tkinter label.
   — Display: The processed image is then displayed in the Tkinter window. If there is an error in fetching or processing the image, an error message is shown instead.

4. Button Functionality:
   — Enable/Disable: The "Generate Image" button is initially disabled and only enabled when a valid category is selected from the dropdown menu.

This code sets up a Tkinter-based GUI application for fetching and displaying random images based on user—selected categories. It involves creating a window with various controls, making HTTP requests to an image API, processing the fetched image, and displaying it in the application window. The code also handles errors and updates the GUI dynamically based on user interactions.
