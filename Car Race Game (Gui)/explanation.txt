### Module Installation

1. Pygame: To run this game, you need to install the Pygame library, which is used for creating the game's graphics and handling user inputs. You can install Pygame using the command = pip install pygame

### Purpose of the Code

This code is for a simple 2D car racing game where the player controls a car and tries to avoid enemy cars. The player's car can move left and right, and the game speeds up as the score increases. The goal is to avoid collisions with enemy cars and stay on the road as long as possible.

### How the Code Works

1. Initialization and Setup:
   — The game initializes by setting up the screen dimensions, colors, and other necessary variables.
   — The game assets, like images for the car, enemy cars, and background, are loaded. If any image fails to load, the game exits.

2. Game Loop:
   — The game runs in a loop where it constantly checks for player inputs, updates the game state, and redraws the screen.
   — The loop continues until a crash occurs, either with an enemy car or by going off the road.

3. Player and Enemy Car:
   — The player's car starts at a specific position and can be moved left or right using keyboard inputs.
   — Enemy cars appear from the top of the screen and move downward. Their positions and speed increase as the score goes up.

4. Collision Detection:
   — The game checks for collisions between the player's car and enemy cars. A collision ends the game.

5. Scoring:
   — The score increases over time, which also causes the game to speed up, making it more challenging.

6. Rendering:
   — The game continuously updates the screen with the new positions of the cars and background.
   — If a game-over condition is met, a message is displayed, and the game resets after a brief pause.

7. Assets and User Interface:
   — The game uses image files for the car, enemy cars, and background. These need to be in the correct path relative to the script.
   — The interface includes a score display and messages for game-over situations.

### How to Use the Code

1. Running the Game:
   — To play the game, simply run the script. Make sure all necessary image files are in the correct location.
   — The game window will open, and you can control the car using the arrow keys.

2. Playing the Game:
   — Move the car left and right to avoid enemy cars.
   — Stay on the road to avoid crashing.

3. Handling Crashes:
   — If you crash into an enemy car or go off the road, a game-over message will appear. The game will restart after a brief pause.

This game provides a simple introduction to game development using Pygame, covering basic concepts like handling user input, updating game states, and rendering graphics.
