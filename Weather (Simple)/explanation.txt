#### 1. Modules to Install

To run this code, you need to install the requests library. This library allows you to send HTTP requests easily in Python. You can install it using the following command: `pip install requests`

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code fetches and displays the current weather information for a specified city. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation:

1. Set Up API Details:
   - The code starts with an API key and a base URL for accessing weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The API key is a unique identifier that allows access to the API service.

2. Input City Name:
   - The user is prompted to enter the name of a city for which they want to get the weather information.

3. Formulate Request URL:
   - Using the base URL, the code constructs a full URL for the API request. This URL includes the API key and the city name entered by the user.

4. Send the Request:
   - The code sends an HTTP request to the weather API using the constructed URL. It uses the requests library to do this.

5. Check Response:
   - After sending the request, the code checks if the response from the API is successful (indicated by a status code of 200). If successful, it proceeds to process the data.

6. Process and Display Data:
   - The code converts the response into a JSON format to easily extract the weather description and temperature.
   - The temperature provided by the API is in Kelvin, so it converts it to Celsius.
   - It then prints the weather description and the temperature in Celsius.

7. Handle Errors:
   - If the API request is not successful (i.e., status code is not 200), the code prints an error message indicating that something went wrong.
