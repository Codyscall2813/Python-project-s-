#### 1. Modules to Install
To run this code, you need to install the following modules:
— `sqlite3` (This is included with Python, so no need to install separately.)
— `tkinter` (Also included with Python.)
— `ttkbootstrap` (You can install it using the following command): `pip install ttkbootstrap`

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code creates a simple flashcards application. Users can create sets of flashcards, add individual cards to these sets, and then review the cards in a learning mode. The application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the user and an SQLite database to store the flashcard sets and their contents.

#### 3. How the Code Works

1. Database Setup:
   — Tables Creation: The code first sets up an SQLite database to store flashcard sets and individual flashcards. Two tables are created: one for the flashcard sets and one for the flashcards themselves.

2. Database Operations:
   — Adding Flashcard Sets and Cards: Functions are provided to add new flashcard sets and individual flashcards to the database.
   — Retrieving Data: Functions to get a list of flashcard sets and retrieve flashcards for a specific set are included.
   — Deleting Sets: A function to delete a flashcard set and its associated cards is also available.

3. GUI Setup:
   — Main Window: The application window is created with a title and size. The GUI uses `tkinter` for the interface and `ttkbootstrap` for styling.
   — Tabs for Different Operations: The GUI is divided into tabs using `ttk.Notebook`, with separate tabs for creating flashcard sets, selecting sets, and learning with flashcards.

4. GUI Elements and Functionality:
   — Create Set Tab: Users can enter a set name, add words and definitions to the set, and save it.
   — Select Set Tab: Users can select an existing flashcard set from a dropdown menu and delete sets if needed.
   — Learn Mode Tab: Users can review flashcards. They can flip the card to see the definition, and navigate between cards using Next and Previous buttons.

5. Main Loop:
   — The code enters the main event loop of the GUI application. This loop keeps the application running and responsive to user actions, such as button clicks and menu selections.

This code sets up a flashcards application that allows users to manage flashcard sets, add cards, and review them interactively. It combines database operations with a graphical user interface to provide a user—friendly experience for creating and studying flashcards.
