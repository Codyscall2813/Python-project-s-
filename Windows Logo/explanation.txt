#### 1. Module to Install

The code uses the `turtle` module, which is part of Python's standard library. You do not need to install it separately.

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This script uses the Turtle Graphics library to draw shapes on a window. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. Initialize Turtle and Screen:
   - Turtle Object: A turtle object is created, which is used to draw shapes and lines.
   - Screen Object: A window (screen) is created where the drawing will appear. The background color of this window is set to black.

2. Draw a Filled Quadrilateral:
   - Setup: The turtle is moved to a starting position without drawing.
   - Drawing: The turtle draws a quadrilateral (a four-sided shape) by moving to four specified points on the screen.
   - Color: The shape is filled with a specific color while drawing.
   - Completion: The filling of the shape is completed.

3. Draw Vertical and Horizontal Lines:
   - Vertical Line: The turtle is repositioned to draw a thick vertical line.
   - Horizontal Line: The turtle is then repositioned to draw a horizontal line across the screen.

4. Keep the Window Open:
   - The window stays open and visible until the user decides to close it. This allows you to view the drawing.

#### Detailed Breakdown

1. Initialize:
   - Turtle: A turtle is an object that moves around the screen to draw. In this script, it’s used to create shapes and lines.
   - Screen: The window where the turtle draws. You can customize the screen’s appearance, like setting the background color.

2. Drawing the Quadrilateral:
   - Movement: The turtle moves to specific coordinates to create a shape.
   - Filling: The shape is filled with color as the turtle moves around the perimeter.

3. Drawing Lines:
   - Vertical Line: The turtle draws a line from the top to the bottom of the screen.
   - Horizontal Line: The turtle draws a line from one side of the screen to the other.

4. Display:
   - Keep Open: The `mainloop` function ensures the window remains open until manually closed.
