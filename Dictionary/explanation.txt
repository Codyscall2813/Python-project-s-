### 1. Modules and Installation

— Modules Used:
  — `tkinter`: This is a standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It comes pre—installed with Python, so no additional installation is needed.
  — `ttkbootstrap`: This is a library that provides modern themes and styles for Tkinter applications. You need to install it using `pip install ttkbootstrap`.
  — `requests`: This library is used to make HTTP requests, which is useful for interacting with web APIs. You can install it using `pip install requests`.

### 2. Purpose of the Code

This code creates a simple dictionary application. The user can enter a word, and the application will fetch and display its definition using an online dictionary API.

### 3. How the Code Works

#### Fetching Definitions

— `get_definition(word)`:
  — This function takes a word as input and uses the `requests` library to fetch its definition from the [Dictionary API](https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/).
  — It sends a request to the API endpoint, including the word as part of the URL.
  — If the response from the API is successful (status code 200), it extracts the meanings and definitions from the JSON data returned by the API.
  — The function then formats these definitions, including the part of speech (e.g., noun, verb) and the definition itself, and returns this formatted string.

#### Handling User Interaction

— `search_definition()`:
  — This function is triggered when the user clicks the "Search" button.
  — It retrieves the word entered by the user, calls `get_definition(word)` to get the definition, and displays the result in a text box.
  — The text box is configured to be read—only to prevent the user from accidentally modifying the displayed definition.

### 4. GUI Components

— The code uses `Tkinter` and `ttkbootstrap` to create a user—friendly interface.
— Window Setup:
  — The main window is set up with a title ("Dictionary App") and a specific size (500x300 pixels).
  — The `Style` class from `ttkbootstrap` is used to apply a modern theme to the widgets.
— Input and Output Fields:
  — The interface includes an entry field where users can type a word, a button to initiate the search, and a text box to display the definition.
  — Widgets like `Label`, `Entry`, and `Button` from `ttk` are used for input and output components, styled using the `ubuntu_font` setting for consistency and readability.

### 5. Event Handling

— The application uses an event—driven model typical of GUIs.
— When the "Search" button is clicked, the `search_definition()` function is called, which updates the text box with the definition of the entered word.
