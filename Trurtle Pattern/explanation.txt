### Explanation of the Fractal Tree Pattern Code

#### 1. Modules to Install

To run this code, you only need Python's built-in `turtle` module. This module is used for drawing shapes and patterns on the screen. It is included with Python, so no additional installation is required.

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code creates a visual representation of fractal trees using the Turtle graphics library. Here’s a breakdown of what it does:

1. Setup:
   - The code sets up the Turtle graphics window with a black background and a title. It initializes a turtle (which is a cursor used for drawing) and configures its initial properties, such as orientation and speed.

2. Drawing a Fractal Tree:
   - The `draw_fractal` function is responsible for creating a single fractal tree. It uses a recursive approach to draw branches. Each branch splits into two smaller branches, creating a tree-like pattern.
   - The function takes parameters for the length of the branches, the color of the branches, and the pen size used for drawing.

3. Recursive Drawing:
   - The tree starts with a given length. If the length is smaller than a threshold, the recursion stops.
   - For each branch, the turtle moves forward, turns left, draws two smaller branches (with adjusted length), and then moves backward to the original position to draw other branches.

4. Drawing Multiple Trees:
   - The `draw_tree` function manages drawing multiple fractal trees with different sizes and colors. It defines a list of parameters for each tree, including branch length, color, and pen size.
   - The function iterates over these parameters, calling the `draw_fractal` function to draw each tree and adjust the turtle’s orientation between trees.

5. Final Steps:
   - After drawing all the trees, the code sets up the Turtle graphics window to close when clicked, allowing the user to see the completed fractal pattern before exiting.

#### How It Works

- Initialization:
  - The turtle is set up with a specified speed and starting position. The graphics window is configured with a black background and a title.

- Drawing Process:
  - The code first draws a fractal tree by repeatedly branching out from the current position of the turtle.
  - Each branch is drawn, then the turtle moves and draws two smaller branches, and then returns to the original position to continue drawing.

- Drawing Multiple Trees:
  - The code draws several fractal trees with varying colors and sizes by iterating through a list of parameters. The turtle's direction is adjusted after each tree to ensure they don’t overlap.

- Completion:
  - Once all the trees are drawn, the graphics window remains open until the user clicks on it, allowing them to view the fractal pattern.

This code uses the Turtle graphics library to create and display a colorful pattern of fractal trees. The fractal trees are drawn using recursive functions, with each tree having different colors and sizes.
