#### 1. Modules to Install

To run this code, you need to install the `colorama` module. This module is used for producing colored text output in the terminal. You can install it using the package manager `pip` with the following command: `pip install colorama`

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

The code is designed to print messages to the terminal in various colors and styles. This is achieved by using the `colorama` module, which allows text to be colored and styled when displayed in the terminal.

#### 3. How Does the Code Work?

1. Initializing Colorama:
   — The `colorama` module is initialized with the `autoreset=True` option. This means that after each print statement, the text style will reset to the default, so that subsequent prints are not affected by previous color settings.

2. Function Definition:
   — A function named `print_colored_message` is defined. This function takes three parameters: `fore_color`, `back_color`, and `message`.
     — `fore_color` specifies the text color.
     — `back_color` specifies the background color.
     — `message` is the text that will be displayed.
   — The function prints the message with the specified foreground and background colors applied.

3. Printing Colored Messages:
   — The code includes several calls to the `print_colored_message` function with different color settings for demonstration.
     — Different foreground (text) and background colors are applied to the messages to showcase how the text will appear in the terminal.

This code allows you to print colored and styled messages in the terminal using the `colorama` module. After installing `colorama`, the script sets up colors and styles for text output and demonstrates various color combinations by printing messages with different foreground and background colors.
