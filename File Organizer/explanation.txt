#### 1. Modules to Install
You need to have Python installed, and this code uses standard libraries, so you don’t need to install any additional modules. The libraries used are:
— `os`: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system, like handling files and directories.
— `shutil`: Provides high-level file operations, such as moving files.

#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

The code organizes files in a specific directory into different subdirectories based on their file types. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

#### 3. How the Code Works

1. Define the Directory Path:
   — The code starts by specifying the directory where files need to be organized. In this example, it’s a folder called “Downloads” on a Windows system.

2. Create Subdirectories:
   — The code checks if specific subdirectories (like "Images," "Music," "Videos," etc.) already exist in the main directory. If a subdirectory doesn’t exist, it creates it.

3. Define File Categories:
   — The code lists different file extensions associated with various categories:
     — Images (e.g., .jpg, .png)
     — Music (e.g., .mp3, .wav)
     — Videos (e.g., .mp4)
     — Documents (e.g., .txt, .pdf)
     — Code (e.g., .py, .html)
     — Other (for any file types not listed)

4. Process Files:
   — The code loops through each file in the specified directory.
   — It skips directories and a specific file named ".DS_Store" (which is common on macOS).
   — For each file, the code determines its type based on the file extension.

5. Move Files to Appropriate Subdirectories:
   — Depending on the file extension, the code moves the file to the corresponding subdirectory (e.g., images go to the "Images" folder).
   — If the file doesn’t match any specified extension, it’s moved to an "Other" directory.

6. Print Status Messages:
   — After moving each file, the code prints a message indicating which file was moved and to which directory.

This code helps you keep your files organized by automatically sorting them into folders based on their types. It first creates the necessary folders if they don’t already exist, then processes each file in the specified directory, and moves them into the appropriate folders according to their file extensions. This helps keep your files neatly categorized without manual sorting.
