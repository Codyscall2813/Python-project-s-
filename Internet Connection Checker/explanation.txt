#### 1. Modules to Install
To run this code, you need to have the following Python module installed:

— requests: This module is used for making HTTP requests to interact with web services.

You can install it using: `pip install requests`


#### 2. What Does the Code Do?

This code checks whether your computer has an active internet connection. It does so by attempting to connect to a well—known website and determining if the connection is successful.

#### 3. How the Code Works

1. Defining the Function:
   — Function Purpose: A function named `test_internet_connection` is defined to handle the task of checking the internet connection.

2. Attempting to Connect:
   — URL Used: The function tries to connect to Google's website, which is a reliable and always available site.
   — HTTP Request: The function sends a request to this URL. If the connection is successful, the website should respond properly.

3. Handling Responses:
   — Success Check: If the website responds without any errors, it means the internet connection is active. The code prints a success message.
   — Error Handling: If there is an issue with connecting to the website (such as no internet connection), the function catches this error and prints a message indicating that the internet connection is not working.

4. Running the Function:
   — Main Execution: The code is set to execute the function when the program is run directly. It will call the `test_internet_connection` function and print the result based on the connection status.

This program helps determine if your computer is connected to the internet by:

— Sending a request to Google's website.
— Checking if the request is successful.
— Printing a message based on whether the internet connection is active or not.
